# About

These are my autohotkeys scripts I use mostly for focusing/opening windows quickly. There are hardcoded windows app_ids for chrome applets so it won't work unless you change those. Typing `<CapsLock><CapsLock>app` should bring up the applications menu in file explorer where you can find this number.

Not that I would recommend anyone to run random AHK scripts from github...
